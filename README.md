Vue.js is a library for building interactive web interfaces. It provides data-reactive components with a simple and flexible API. Core features include:

* [Dead simple, unobtrusive reactivity using plain JavaScript objects](http://vuejs.org/guide/overview.html#Reactive-Data-Binding).
* [Component-oriented development style with tooling support](http://vuejs.org/guide/overview.html#Component-System)
* Lean and extensible core
* [Flexible transition effect system](http://vuejs.org/guide/transitions.html)
* Fast without the need for complex optimization

Note that Vue.js only supports ES5-compliant browsers (IE8 and below are not supported). To check out live examples and docs, visit [vuejs.org](http://vuejs.org).

# Laravel PHP Framework
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

# Official Documentation
Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
